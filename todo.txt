Were you able to fix the BUY and SELL signals on the chart? I only see 1 signal on the chart.

Also I'm seeing a few more issues:
1. I see a "subscription has expired" message for users whos subscription hasn't expired. See screenshot.
Steps to reproduce:
Login with kiran/kiran
Logout.
Login with kaygee/kaygee   ==========> DONE

2. I see an API call to favorites when the subscription has expired. This shouldn't happen. See screenshot.

3. In the login screen, if the credentials are incorrect - we should only see a red text. Please remove the popup.  ================> DONE

4. The download CSV is not calling the API correctly. It is only downloading the page being viewed.
Please see the API docs on calling the CSV API.
