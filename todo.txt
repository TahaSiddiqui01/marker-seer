TODO: Regarding the influencer issue: When you click on NVDA and click on Influencers:
The title is supposed to show Influencers: NVDA Nvdia (Data from the NVDA ticker)
It is currently showing the value of the first row of the table.   ==========> DONE

TODO: Regarding the pagination issue: If there is only a single page, the pagination should only show: Prev | 1 | Next (with next and previous disabled)

It is currently showing: Prev | 1 | 1 | 2 | ... | 1 | Next   ==========> DONE

The API returns the number of pages - couldn't you estimate based on that?  =========> DONE

TODO: Regarding the charts: You can get more data by increasing the value for the days parameter. The default value is 30. You can increase it up to 90. Let me know if that helps.  =======> DONE

TODO: It seems like the dashboards show "Oops nothing to show" whenever it is loading data. Can we change that to a more meaningful loading gif/icon?  ====> DONE

TODO: Influencers export to CSV:
You just need to add type=csv

To get influencers for NVDA:
GET 'http://www.marketseer.ai/seer/api/influencers?ticker=NVDA'

To export to CSV influencers of NVDA:
GET 'http://www.marketseer.ai/seer/api/influencers?ticker=NVDA&type=csv'

See screenshot.  ===========> DONE

TODO: Analyze page showing incorrect information.
Ex: FREQ:
"no_of_trades": 0 : UI shows No of signals: N/A
"predicted_signal": "NO_SIGNAL" : UI shows Next predicted signal: N/A

Ex: GOOG:
"ai_confidence_index": "97.61904761904762" : UI shows AI confidence index: N/A
"predicted_signal": "NO_SIGNAL", : UI shows Next predicted signal: 106.61
"30_day_directional_accuracy_percent": "0" : UI shows Prediction accuracy: 108.24

Note: Next predicted signal is displayed twice.

Also Next predicted price is missing.

There are a lot of errors here. Please verify that the data is correctly being displayed on the UI.

TODO: Regarding token usage:
This was the first token retrieved from /tokens:
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNjgxOTQ1MDYxLCJqdGkiOiI5NTczZThkNGMyZGM0ODkyOGIxNWQ0YWRlOTc4YWY0YyIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoia2lyYW4ifQ.UAHQ_TR8tAwtczde3TuXZ-U1-OhbaocG5Hoksh41Z6E

later i see a call to /refresh and you received:
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNjgxOTQ1ODAxLCJqdGkiOiIzYTkxMTYzOWQwNTQ0NWNiODU4MzM5MjAwM2Q2MGI1ZSIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoia2lyYW4ifQ.z07GeBXnVkNkbdbgpeK9NrjDg1N

later i see all API calls going with a different token.
Can you please verify this?


TODO: I've also attached a few screenshot with too many API calls going out for each page.   ===========> DONE
